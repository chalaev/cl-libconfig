This package allows using standard libconfig library in Common LISP.

Apart from its usage as a handy configuration tool, libconfig is also a universal language for communication between programs written in different programming
languages. Also it serves me as a data storage interface.

Requires linux packages: libconfig-dev

* Quick start
I assume that sbcl is already installed and quicklisp resides in the home directory.
My lisp is also installed locally, ~/local/bin/sbcl

1. For Debian and Ubuntu linux: apt-get install libconfig-dev
2. Place the files API.lisp grovel.lisp libconfig.lisp package.lisp libconfig.asd
   into the direcory ~/quicklisp/local-projects/libconfig/
3. cd tests/
4. ~/local/bin/sbcl --load 1.lisp
5. Now examine 1.lisp, 1.conf and newly created ~/tmp.conf
