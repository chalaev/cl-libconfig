;; TODO: do not export functions which do not appear in the tests/*.lisp

;;
;; The functions below are classified as "high-level" and "low-level".
;; The low-level ones I try to do as short as possible on the cost of safety (error handling).
;; For the high-level functions I try to provide error handling.
;; Naming is a serious issue: I have to name the functions once and foreverâ€¦
