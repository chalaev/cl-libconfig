This package allows using standard [[http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/][libconfig]] library in Common LISP.
Requires linux libconfig-dev package.

[[http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/][libconfig]] supports several important data types, see write-structure description below.
Apart from its usage as a handy configuration tool, [[http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/][libconfig]] is also a universal
language for communication between programs written in different programming languages
and in different OS.

Note that [[http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html][libconfig is not thread-safe]].

* Quick start
I assume that sbcl is already installed and quicklisp resides in home directory.
lisp is also installed locally, ~/local/bin/sbcl
1. Install libconfig-dev:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   apt-get install libconfig-dev
   #+END_SRC
2. download the code (I assume that your quicklisp directory is ~/quicklisp/):
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects/
   git clone https://github.com/chalaev/cl-libconfig
   mv cl-libconfig/tests ~/test-cl-libconfig
   #+END_SRC
3. Ensure that the tests are running ok:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ~/local/bin/sbcl --load read.lisp
   ~/local/bin/sbcl --load write.lisp
   ~/local/bin/sbcl --load change.lisp
   #+END_SRC
4. Now examine ~/test-cl-libconfig/*.lisp, read-1.conf and (newly created) change.conf.
   The test files are designed to be self-explanatory; they show how one can read, wrote, and change
conf files in common lisp using this software.

* Functions
** read-file
Syntax: (read-file fileName)
Reads entire conf-file named fileName into the hash-table.
See usage example in tests/read.lisp

* Macros
** with-read-config-file
Syntax: (with-read-config-file fileName body)
where fileName is the name of the conf-file to read (the conf-file must comply with the standard libconfig syntax).
Inside this macro, macro read-setting can be used.
See usage example in tests/read.lisp
** with-write-config-file
Syntax: (with-write-config-file fileName body)
where fileName is the name of the conf-file to write.
This conf-file will be newly created; an existing file wil be ovewritten.
Inside this macro, function write-structure can be used.
See usage example in tests/write.lisp
** read-setting
Syntax: (read-setting parName [default])
where parName is the name of the parameter from the conf-file,
and optional default parameter specifies the value to be returned in case the
parameter is not found in the conf-file.
See usage example in tests/read.lisp
** with-rw-config-file
Syntax: (with-rw-config-file fileName body)
with-rw-config-file is similar to with-read-config-file and with-write-config-file;
First, it reads conf-file named fileName (which must exist or the condition conf-file-read-error is raised).
In the body one can read/erase/write conf-parameters like it is done
inside "with-read-config-file" and "with-write-config-file" environments.
See usage example in tests/change.lisp
** write-structure
(To be used from inside of "with-rw-config-file" and "with-write-config-file" macros.)
Syntax: (write-structure parName value)
where value must have one of the following types:
integer string boolean cons hash single-float double-float ratio,
The value parameter can also have nested structure:
for example, it can be an array/hash of any of above-enumerated types.
See usage examples in tests/write.lisp and tests/change.lisp

** remove-setting
(To be used from inside of with-rw-config-file macro.)
Removes a setting.
Syntax: (remove-setting parName)
where parName is the name of the setting which we want to remove.
See usage example in tests/change.lisp

* Exceptions (conditions)
** conf-file-read-error
This condition occurs when the conf-file does not exist or is unreadable.
See usage example in tests/read.lisp

** config-parse-error
This condition occurs when the conf-file has grammar errors.
This often happens for the conf-files that have been writen manually.
An extra bracket, brace, or a missing semicolon in the conf-file will raise this condition.
